    // .then: promises
    // previously, they used to use call back functions to throw errors or to proceed
    // nested callbacks --> callback hell (since it's difficult to read and debug)
    // they were asynchronous functions: we don't know when they'll complete
    // each function depends on the result or return of the previous one

    // promise: promise that this object will have a result value: resolved or rejected value
    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
    // resolve: when API call is successful
    // rejected: when API call returns an error
    // .then: gets the resolved value
    // .catch: returns the error or rejected value

    // response is a random name, we can name another, same for users
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')

  // the reason why we need a unique key is because React needs to know which
  // element it needs to update if one of the elements in the array has a value that changes
  // so that it does not re-render everything
  // React is smart
  // https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-use-the-map()-function-to-export-javascript-in-react

  // when to use the key attribute:
  // Anytime you use the map() function inside of render, 
  // or you have a list of the same jsx elements one after another, 
  // they need a key attribute (and CRA will warn you about it if you miss it)

  // map(): explained in Arrays.js

  // <h1 key = {monster.id}> {monster.username} </h1>
  // we can get any key-value pair we want from the json in the link

  // monster is a random name, we can choose another

  // <CardList age="22"/>
  // moving on to children props for a better experience

  /* 
  <CardList>
    <h2>Mahmoud</h2>
  </CardList>

  // now the CardList component is responsible for generating our monsters cards,
  // and not our App component

  // e in onChange represents the synthetic event
  // a native event that the browser uses to do all kinds of different things

  // <input type='search' placeholder="Search monsters" onChange={e => console.log(e)} />
  // <input type='search' placeholder="Search monsters" onChange={e => console.log(e.target)} />
  // <input type='search' placeholder="Search monsters" onChange={e => console.log(e.target.value  )} />
  
  // normally if we want to check if the state is updated, we console log after the line
  // which updates the state, but, the searchField key in our case is 1 letter behind
  // if you type 'a', the search field shows empty string (searchField not updated), 
  // if we type another 'a' it shows only 1 'a'
  // this is because setState is an asynchronous function call
  // synchronous: is an action that we expect that will happen almost immediatly
  // and js knows the amount of time this action or function will take,
  // so js will wait for that thing to finish before it continues running the rest of the code
  // asynchronous: is an action or event is something that take an indefinite amount of time
  // that js doesn't know; so it runs the rest of the code first, and when the async event
  //  finishes, it then runs this finished event
